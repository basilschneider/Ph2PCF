Cbc_default_electron# CMS Ph2 ACF (Acquisition & Control Framework) 

##### Contains:

    - A middleware API layer, implemented in C++, which wraps the firmware calls and handshakes into abstracted functions

- A C++ object-based library describing the system components (CBCs,
        Hybrids, Boards) and their properties(values, status)

- several utilities (like visitors to execute certain tasks for each item in the hierarchical Item description)

- a tools/ directory with several utilities (currently: calibration, hybrid testing, common-mode analysis)

    - some applications: datatest, interfacetest, hybridtest, system, calibrate, commission, fpgaconfig

##### Different versions

    On this Repo, you can find different version of the software :
    - a hopefully working and stable version on the master branch
    - An in-progress version in the Dev branch

### Setup

Firmware for the GLIB can be found in /firmware. Since the "old" FMC flavour is deprecated, only new FMCs (both connectors on the same side) are supported.
You'll need Xilinx Impact and a [Xilinx Platform Cable USB II] (http://uk.farnell.com/xilinx/hw-usb-ii-g/platform-cable-configuration-prog/dp/1649384)

#### Setup on the Strasbourg [VM v1.1.0] (http://sbgcmstrackerupgrade.in2p3.fr/) 

1. Remove the current gcc and old boost libraries:

          $> sudo yum remove devtoolset-1.1-gcc-debuginfo
          $> sudo yum remove boost

2. Install the latest gcc compiler:

          $> sudo yum install devtoolset-2
          $> sudo ln -s /opt/rh/devtoolset-2/root/usr/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
          $> hash -r

This should give you gcc 4.8.1:

          $> gcc --version

3. Finally, update uHAL to version 2.3:

          $> sudo yum groupremove uhal
          $>wget http://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/export/28265/tags/ipbus_sw/uhal_2_3_0/scripts/release/cactus.slc5.x86_64.repo 

(You may need the --no-check-certificate)

          $> sudo cp cactus.slc5.x86_64.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/cactus.repo
          $> sudo yum clean all
          $> sudo yum groupinstall uhal

4. Re-compile ROOT using the new gcc 4.8: [Instructions](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/installing-root-source) - make sure to use "fixed location installation"

Note: You may also need to set the environment variables (or source setup.sh):

          $> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cactus/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          $> export PATH=/opt/cactus/bin:$PATH

#### Setup on SLC5/6

1. Install the latest gcc compiler:

For SLC5:

        $> wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/slc5-devtoolset.repo http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/devtoolset/slc5-devtoolset.repo
    
For SLC6:

        $> wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/slc6-devtoolset.repo http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/devtoolset/slc6-devtoolset.repo
        
then:

        $> sudo yum install devtoolset-2
        $> sudo ln -s /opt/rh/devtoolset-2/root/usr/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
        $> hash -r

This should give you gcc 4.8.1:

        $> gcc --version

2. Install uHAL  version 2.3:

For SLC5:

        $> wget http://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/export/28265/tags/ipbus_sw/uhal_2_3_0/scripts/release/cactus.slc5.x86_64.repo 

or for SLC6:

        $> wget http://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/export/28265/tags/ipbus_sw/uhal_2_3_0/scripts/release/cactus.slc6.x86_64.repo 

(You may need the --no-check-certificate)

for SLC5:

        $> sudo cp cactus.slc5.x86_64.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/cactus.repo

for SLC6:

        $> sudo cp cactus.slc6.x86_64.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/cactus.repo

then

        $> sudo yum clean all
        $> sudo yum groupinstall uhal

3. Install CERN ROOT: [Instructions](https://root.cern.ch/building-root) - make sure to use "fixed location installation"

Note: You may also need to set the environment variables (or source setup.sh):

        $> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cactus/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        $> export PATH=/opt/cactus/bin:$PATH

### The Ph2_ACF Software :

(provided you installed the latest version of gcc, µHal, boost as mentioned above)

1. Clone the GitHub repo.
  

        $> source setup.sh

3. Launch 

        $> systemtest --help

command if you want to test the parsing of the HWDescription.xml file

4. Launch

        $> datatest --help

command if you want to test if you can correctly read data.

6. Launch

        $> calibrate --help

to calibrate a hybrid,

        $> hybridtest --help

to test a hybird's I2C registers and input channel connectivity

          $> cmtest --help

to run the CM noise study

          $> pulseshape --help

to measure the analog pulseshape of the cbc

          $> configure --help

to apply a configuration to the CBCs

7. Launch

          $> commission --help

to do latency & threshold scans

8. Launch 

          $> fpgaconfig --help

to upload a new FW image to the GLIB

9. Launch

          $> miniDAQ --help

to save binary data from the GLIB to file

10. Launch

          $> miniDQM --help

to run the DQM code from the June '15 beamtest


##### What can you do with the software ?

At the moment the package provides the following features:

  - Configure the Glib & Cbcs
  - Manipulate the registers in the Glib
  - Manipulate the registers in the Cbcs
  - Read Data
  - Calibrate Hybrids
  - Validate Hybrids
  - Perform CM noise tests
  - user external trigger and clock signals for your tests
  - upload .mcs files to the GLIB
  - perform simple commissioning procedures
  - save binary data to file
  - create simple DQM histograms from binary data
  - measure the pulseshape of the CBC amp
  - any other routine you want to implement yourself ... 


##### Nota Bene:
When you write a register in the Glib or the Cbc, the corresponding map of the HWDescription object in memory is also updated, so that you always have an exact replica of the HW Status in the memory.

Register values are:
  - 8-bit unsigend integers for the CBCs that should be edited in hex notation, i.e. '0xFF'
  - 32-bit unsigned integers for the GLIB: decimal values

For debugging purpose, you can activate DEV_FLAG in the sources or in the Makefile and also activate the uHal log in RegManager.cc.


#### External Clock and Trigger:

In order to use external Clock and Trigger functionality, a DIO5 mezzanine is required. It is available from the [CERN OHR](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-dio-5chttla) and sold by several commercial vendors.
For instructions on how to use it, see this [file](https://github.com/gauzinge/Ph2_ACF/blob/Dev/doc/TK_DAQ_MONO_GLIB3_FMCDIO5_v3.0_09-12-2014.pdf). The [firmware](https://github.com/gauzinge/Ph2_ACF/tree/Dev/firmware) is included in this repository.

### Known Issues:

Several bugs / problematic behavior has been reported by various users that is not direclty linked to the Ph2_ACF libraries, however, some workarounds are provided:

- When configuring a CBC object (writing all registers at once), the MSB of the Register "FrontEncControl" is read back incorrectly. This only manifests in electron mode (0xC3 instead of 0x43). The cause of this problem is identified as a FW artefact and the error itself can be safely ignored until the problem is solved. The chips will still properly configure and data quality should not be affected.

- uHAL exceptions and UDP timeouts when reading larger packet sizes from the GLIB board: 
this can happen for some users (cause not yet identified) but can be circumvented by changing the line

"ipbusudp-2.0://192.168.000.175:50001"

in the connections.xml file to

"chtcp-2.0://localhost:10203?target=192.168.000.175:50001"

& then launching the CACTUS control hub by the command:

/opt/cactus/bin/controlhub_start

This uses TCP protocol instead of UDP which accounts for packet loss but decreases the performance.

- SegmentationViolations on lines that contain

gStyle->Set ... ;

statements. This has been observed by several users on the VM and can be fixed by re-compiling ROOT using GCC 4.8
